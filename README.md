# Pokemon GO Checklist
**Note!** The data is currently out of date as this was developed in Summer 2022. 

A checklist to manage a Pokemon GO collection inside Pokemon HOME. The list allows the user to see, which Pokemon are legal in Pokemon GO or a game they can travel to and evolve. The shiny mark next to the image represents shiny legality. There are also checkbox options to hide different parts of the list based on preferences. On hover, the last column displays a calculated box position for the pokemon in question, to allow easy organization inside of Pokemon HOME. The column next to it gives information on which games the pokemon can travel to.

**Important!** There is an option to export your data as it's stored in the user's local storage only, but currently there is no upload functionality. Currently this project is halted so I am not sure if this will be ever implemented, but at least it's a way to save your data.

**Note on browser:** Seems like the page isn't visually pretty in Firefox, which needs to be fixed. Usage of Chromium-based browsers is recommended for now.
